# Work protocol: Software Engineer

### Getting the work done, and learning something new! üôå

This protocol is aimed to help keep the focus during the work day, by setting clear intentions before starting, keeping track of what has been done and also what was learned during the day. It should also keep an eye on increasing the skills overall.

## Work Protocol

> Start the day with clear issues or items to work on, and imagine how a success scenario would look like.

### Preparing

- [ ] Have a daily journey ready to note down questions, ideas and learnings.
- [ ] Have 2l of water ready at the desk.

### Reasoning

- [ ] What are the constraints of the issue I am trying to solve or implement?
- [ ] Can I change the constraints or do I have to adjust to them?
- [ ] In which wider, underlying system is the feature or issue operating on?
- [ ] Do I know enough about the system to make educated assumptions?
- [ ] Do I know what success looks like for this issue?

### Doing

- [ ] Have a clear Linear/GitHub issue created.
- [ ] Open a PR against that issue.
- [ ] Add a proper description to the PR.
- [ ] Don‚Äôt focus on the perfect solution first, make it work.
- [ ] Move code around freely, don‚Äôt be afraid of being messy at first.
- [ ] Note down questions and findings in the journal.

### Unblocking

- [ ] What is preventing me from making progress (lack of energy, focus, clear path forward, a blocking issue someone else is working on,...)?
- [ ] Start a Slack message to a colleague (without sending it), explaining the problem and where I need help.
- [ ] Imagine what a more senior/experienced colleague would suggest to me and act on that.

_Especially in vague, unclear work environments (StartUps, leaderless team, open domains), it is vital to set own constraints or goals. This could be improving the latency of parts of the system, increasing the readability of the codebase, improving the documentation, or enabling a feature you think might be beneficial._

## Appendix

### Owning the issue

- Clarifying the issue, asking enough dumb questions in the beginning to be really clear what needs to be done.
- Understanding the business value/use case for the issue being done (well).
- Understand what ‚Äúwell done‚Äù means for this issue.
- Understand who will be unblocked by it.

### Staying on track

- Use ChatGPT to explain the problem to gain new insights into possible solutions.
- Figure out key metrics of the task being well done.
- Ask stakeholders for early feedback, or on input during the work.

### Maintain quality

- Testing the main success route and edge cases.
- Document the code written.
- Can it be written more performant?
- Can the code be more concise?

### Regain focus and energy

- Take a cold shower (30s to 1 min.).
- Go for a run (<1h).
- Step away from the screen, walk outside and outline the issue in my head.
  Medidate.
